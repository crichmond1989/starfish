        President and founder of Starfish Advocates, Inc., Bob Klostermeyer “walked” on starfish littered beaches for many years before he decided to become a “thrower” of
        starfish. Graduating from the University of Florida Law School in 1983, he practiced law for several years assisting with domestic adoptions before becoming employed at a
        major university in the Midwest. It was during his time as a college professor that he had the opportunity to assist with another adoption that fueled his passion to become
        an advocate and financial supporter of domestic adoption.

        In 2003, two children from a bleak background were adopted into a loving family of five. As Bob stood in the judge’s chambers watching the completion of the adoption
        process, he witnessed something greater than the end of a legal matter. That day, he experienced the amazing change that starts when children are adopted by a committed,
        loving family. At the conclusion of the hearing, a small group of the children’s case workers stood and applauded. Having that many case workers present and seeing their
        passion was unexpected and uncommon.

        Because of his friendship with the adoptive parents, Bob had the privilege over 13 years to see those two children mature into wonderful young adults. He notes that, “the
        commitment by the adopting family and the motivation of the adopted children certainly assisted with the positive result; but the surprising conclusion that happened on
        that day in 2003 seemed to provide the spark that made the difference in everyone’s lives.”

        Following a more than 20 year career at colleges and universities, Bob created Starfish Advocates, Inc. The nonprofit’s origins are grounded upon his memories of that day
        in the judge’s chambers. Additionally, the Bible tells us that the highest form of sacrificial love is to help orphans and widows in their time of need. (James 1:27)

        The beaches of life are teeming with children who through no fault of their own have become parentless. Choosing to make a difference in their lives starts the process of
        becoming a “thrower” of starfish. Starfish Advocates is about becoming more than an observer and committing to help the legal orphans dying on the beaches of life.
